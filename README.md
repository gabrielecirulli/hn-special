# HN Special â€” A Hacker News extension 
A theme and extension for [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) that improves the look and feel and adds some interesting features.

The available features can be enabled or disabled based on your personal preference. New feature contributions are welcome!

You can install this extension [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hn-special-an-addition-to/cchaceegbflphbdpfocjalgjhjoahiia).

## Planned features
 - A modern looking visual theme **DONE**
 - Infinite scrolling **DONE**
 - Open links in new tab **DONE**
 - More accurate domain names **DONE**
 - Hide articles with certain keywords (maybe)
 - Mark all as read (maybe)

## Contributing
The CSS is built using [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). If you'd like to contribute, you should first install [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and then get `stylus`:
```
npm install -g stylus
```

You can then tell Stylus to watch the changes to the `.styl` file and compile automatically:
```
stylus -c -w hn_theme.styl
```

### A note about the CSS
Some of the selectors in the CSS are very contrived. I found it was the only way to select what I wanted in a document made of tables within tables with barely any classes. I tried to use class selectors wherever I could, but it's mostly unavoidable to go down a long chain of selectors. If you spot any ways to improve any of the selectors, please make a pull request and I'll be glad to take it in!

### Adding a module
If you want to add a new module, please edit `defaults.json` and add a descriptive key for your module (it will be used as the actual module name in the settings panel) and increment the `settings_version`. Please keep it disabled by default if it's a change that could overwhelm some users. When the first new module will be published, some code will be added to notify users about the update through the settings menu.

For the actual code, make a JavaScript file with the same name as the module, and subscribe to the settings object through the module's key (take a look at `open_links_in_new_tabs.js` for an example). If the setting is enabled from the interface, your module's code will be executed. **NOTE**: don't forget to add your JS file to `manifest.json` and uninstall/reinstall the extension before you begin developing. Simply reloading it won't work.
